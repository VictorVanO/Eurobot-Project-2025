# Eurobot-Project-2025

## Pamis instructions :
### 1) Groupie :
- Place the two motors on the first robot plate and assure that it is positioned on the appropriate holes. Mount the encoder wheels on the inside of the motors
- On the second plate, place the encoders on there dedicated mount 
- With two M3x15mm screws and nuts, fix the Infrared sensors mount at the front of the second plate and fix the sensors on the mount with two M3x15mm screws and nuts
- with four M3x20mm screws, attach the Arduino mount on the second plate and place the Arduino in it
- With four M3x15mm standoff screws, assemble the two red plates. Be sure to keep the motors well in place as they will fixed between the two plates and guide the encoder wheels trough the sensors
- With two M3x30mm screws fix the Ultrasonic sensor mount on the front of the Arduino mount and slide the sensors into the support
- With two M3x20mm standoff screws fix the Servo/Emergency button mount on the rear of the Arduino mount and slide motor and the button into the support
### 2) Superstar :
